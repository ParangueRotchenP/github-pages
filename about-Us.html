        <h1 class="slide-title">OUR HISTORY</h1>
        <p class="slide-paragraph">Athena Vanguard Academy was founded with a singular vision: to provide an exceptional educational experience that empowers young women to become leaders, scholars, and change-makers in their communities and the world. From its humble beginnings, the academy has grown into a dynamic institution that blends academic rigor with personal growth, fostering an environment where each student can thrive.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="ITitle">The Beginning</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The journey of Athena Vanguard Academy began in 2020 when three visionary founders— Ms. Villanueva, Ms. Parangue, and Ms. Castillo—came together with a shared passion for education and a commitment to empowering young women. They recognized the importance of creating a learning environment where girls could not only excel academically but also develop the confidence, leadership skills, and resilience necessary to succeed in an ever-changing world.
            <br>
            With their combined expertise in education, leadership, and community building, the founders set out to create a school that would challenge traditional norms and provide a platform for young women to reach their full potential. Drawing inspiration from the values of Athena—the Greek goddess of wisdom, courage, and strategic warfare—they named the school Athena Vanguard Academy, symbolizing strength, intelligence, and a forward-thinking approach to education.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="ITitle">The Growth of Athena Vanguard Academy</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            In the early years, the school operated with a small but dedicated group of students and faculty, with a focus on providing personalized attention and nurturing individual growth. The founders worked closely with the school community to establish a strong academic foundation, emphasizing not only traditional subjects but also leadership development, creative expression, and social responsibility.
            As word spread about the academy’s unique approach to education, Athena Vanguard Academy began to attract more students who were eager to be part of an institution that prioritized both academic excellence and holistic development. The school expanded its curriculum to include a wide range of academic programs, including STEM, the arts, business, and social sciences, ensuring that students were prepared for the diverse opportunities that awaited them in the world beyond the classroom.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="ITitle">A Commitment to Excellence</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the years, Athena Vanguard Academy has remained dedicated to its founding principles of integrity, leadership, and empowerment. The school has continually adapted to meet the changing needs of its students and the broader educational landscape, integrating the latest teaching methods, technologies, and global perspectives into the curriculum.
